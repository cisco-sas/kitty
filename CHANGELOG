Version 0.6.7 (2016-04-18)
==========================

* new feature: [KittyActor] a new class, KittyActor, is now the base class for monitors and controllers
* new feature: [KittyActor] a new API is_victim_alive can be used to check if the victim is alive, it is called in a loop in pre-test
* enhancement: [BaseFuzzer] default logging level is now INFO, hence less messages are printed, can be controlled from cmd line args
* bugfix: [BaseFuzzer] update test info before the calling target's pre_test
* new feature: [Report] use 'status' field instead of 'failed' field in the report. currently support FAILED, PASSED and ERROR.
* enhancement: [WebInterface] html - improvements of caching, window size, cell overflow
* new feature: [WebInterface] html - report table now shows test status and reason
* bugfix: [kitty-tool] fixed command line option parsing
* new feature: [kitty-tool] added checks for mutation indices in "generate"
* new feature: [kitty-tool] print progress and current field path in "generate"
* bugfix: [DataModel] fixed "field path" in field info
* new feature: [DataModel] new fields - Offset & AbsoluteOffset - can hold the offset of a specific field inside the template
* new feature: [DataModel] new conditions - BitMaskSet and BitMaskNotSet
* new feature: [DataModel] absolute name resolution of fields
* enhancement: [DataModel] perform render in two passes when needed, avoid (some) redundant rendering in between
* new feature: [DataModel] new container - List - will perform the standard mutations of each of the internal fields, but will also perform mutations on the order and existence of its elements.
* enhancement: [DataModel] reduce number of mutations for BitField & String field. This cuts the mutation count to about half of the previous count.
* new feature: [DataModel] now String and BitField have a human friendly mutation description in the info

Version 0.6.6 (2016-04-03)
==========================

* bugfix: [WebInterface] Fixed responses to API calls (pause/resume)
* bugfix: [ClientFuzzer] fix advancement in path when get_mutation is called
* bugfix: [BaseFuzzer] fixed typo in cmd line arg
* new feature: [WebInterface] New web interface design, allowing export of reports and showing more relevant status
* new feature: [DataManager] Support generic (volatile) content operations (still synchronized)
* new feature: [kitty-tool] add out-file name format command line option
* new feature: [Fuzzer] perform environment test before starting the actual fuzzing session

Version 0.6.5 (2016-03-20)
==========================

* bugfix: [ClientFuzzer] Fixed off-by-one bug in the fuzzing index (start/end) of client fuzzer
* bugfix: [ClientFuzzer] Protect from multiple calls to start (can now restart stack without restarting fuzzer)
* bugfix: [ClientFuzzer] Fixed exception when there are no stage to log
* new feature: [ClientFuzzer] Added requested stages (by the stack) to the report
* new feature: [ClientFuzzer] Added API to check if client fuzzer is done fuzzing
* new feature: [Remote] Added stop API for RPC server

Version 0.6.4 (2016-03-13)
==========================

* bugfix: [package] fixed package name in get_distribution calls

Version 0.6.3 (2016-03-13)
==========================

* bugfix: [Web Interface] cleaner shutdown
* new feature: [Tools] kitty-tool, will replace other cmd line tools in the future
* now indexed in PyPi as kittyfuzzer

Version 0.6.2 (2016-03-01)
==========================

* bugfix: [Data Manager] Handle exceptions in tasks by raising them in caller context
* bugfix: [Data Manager] Unicode strings are now properly encoded in the report
* bugfix: [Data Model] BitFieldMultiByteEncoder: fixed byte order
* bugfix: [Data Model] BlockOperation: block size validation
* bugfix: [Data Model] ByteAlignedBitsEncoder: fixed byte alignment (issue #11)
* bugfix: [Data Model] ByteFlips: removed silent failures
* bugfix: [Data Model] If/IfNot: Protect from recursive rendering
* bugfix: [Web Interface] handle errors and return descriptive message when error occurs in the report API

* new feature: [Data Model] BitFieldMultiByteEncoder: support for little endian
* new feature: [Data Model] ElementCount: field that holds the number of elements in given container
* new feature: [Data Model] IndexOf: field that holds the index of a given field in its container
* new feature: [Data Model] RandomBits: Similar to RandomBytes, but in bits (allows non-byte aligned fields)
* new feature: [Tools] kitty-template-tester: print version

* removed feature: [Data Model] Crypto Encoders were removed from Kitty and now available in Katnip v0.2.2 this removes the dependency in pycrypto from kitty (issue #7)
